## Description
Ever needed help typing a README file? This project helps you to accomplish that feat by asking you a series of questions and placing each response in its correct section. The final result is a generated README file that you can use to attach to your project. Each README file contains seven sections: Description, Installation, Usage, Contribution, Tests, License, and Questions.

 ## Installation
Make sure to download Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download. Once Node.js is downloaded, make sure to open your terminal and use the command "npm install --save-dev" to use Node.js. Once that's done, use the command "npm i inquirer" to install the inquirer package, and you should be able to use the project.

 ## Usage
The project can be used to create a README file for anyone who is unfamiliar with creating their own. This application asks all of the necessary questions needed for a README file and places each answer in their respective sections. Please view this video for a demonstration on how this project can be used: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yMLYbIjJQeuomf5qlzUfxoSoG972Le4y/view

 ## Contribution
 All contributions are welcome. If you have a suggestion on how to improve this project, please don't hesitate to fork the repo and create a pull request. Please don't forget to give this project a star! It'll be greatly appreciated!

 ## Tests
 Type "node index.js" to run the application, and type in an answer for each prompt. Once done, you'll see a README file generated. From there, you can check the format and see if each function is working as it should. I've ran this project through numerous tests to ensure that it works for all cases. For a test case example, please refer to the video link in the Usage section.

## License
 None.
